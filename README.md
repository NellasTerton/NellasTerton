### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Egor Iakobson :raising_hand: 
I started my career at Tatneft from the position of a technician, whose duties included inventory control of personal protective equipment. After the introduction of tender procedures in organization, I began to develop tender documentation, later taking the position of a specialist and then a leading specialist in the tender department. Now I want to enter IT. Watching the digitalization of the world and the success of people immersed in the world of IT, I began to realize that what seemed incredible and incomprehensible yesterday is reality today. A reality that needs to be studied if you want to develop as a person and as a specialist. Having studied several training courses from Yandex.Practice, I made a choice in favor of a data analyst. I am interested in formulating hypotheses and testing them based on the available data. Working with spreadsheets and huge scorecards fascinates me and makes me want to get to the bottom of things.

During the course, I did the following research:

- Analysis of patterns that determine the success of gaming products.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing.

- Analysis of the causes of the company's losses and search for ways to eliminate them.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, cohort analysis, unit economics, product metrics, Seaborn.

- Analysis of a large online store based on testing results - prioritization of hypotheses, evaluation of A / B testing results, conclusions.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, statistical hypothesis testing.
